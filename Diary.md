# dag 1

I have created some sort of database schema where i will have users, courses, notes and note_blocks.

First i want to come up with a MVP (minimal viable product)

my minimal viable product consists of having users, being able to CRUD (create,read,update and delete) notes in courses.

i think alot of time is going to be spent on making the note taking features. adding blocks for code, headers etc. But this is for later.

everything today has gone well. I have learnt that i need to start the vite dev server with "npm run dev" for the project to be able to run in "php artisan serve" I have also learnt that i can use "php artisan make:model "model_name" -mc" to create a model, migration and controller at the same time.

I used chatGPT to consult about the database structure, im trying out different ways of prompting to get the result i want. Today i tried to tell it that it is an experienced laravel programmer and it gave me satisfying results.

# next day agenda

next time i want to fix the pages so that i can route into courses and see notes. for this i will have to create routes in
web.php for showing course data. I might even look into creating notes.
